# Overview
This repo is designed to compare the production artifacts built by **SystemJS** vs. **Webpack**. Currently, the [`SystemJS`](https://github.com/JayKan/angular2-todo) repo is using `systemjs-builder` to minify, mangle and rollup to produce the production build, whereas the current repo is using Webpack's `UglifyJsPlugin` optimizer plugin to minimize and compress the final production build.       

# Dependencies
* `node >= 5.11`
* `npm > 3.x`
* globals (`npm install --global`)
    * `typescript`
    * `webpack`
    * `webpack-dev-server`
    * `tslint`
